## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Dynamic Payment Channel Network seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability?

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to ukpongelijah69@gmail.com

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not exploit a security issue you discover for any reason other than testing
- Report any vulnerability you've discovered promptly
- Follow our bug bounty program rules

### Security Measures in Place

The smart contract implements several security measures:

1. **Access Control**

   - Function-level access restrictions
   - Owner-only administrative functions
   - Participant verification for channel operations

2. **Transaction Safety**

   - Signature verification for state updates
   - Nonce tracking to prevent replay attacks
   - Balance validation to prevent overflow

3. **Dispute Resolution**

   - Time-locked dispute period
   - Cooperative and unilateral closure mechanisms
   - Emergency withdrawal capabilities

4. **Data Validation**
   - Input validation for all parameters
   - Balance checks before transfers
   - Channel state verification

### Known Security Limitations

- The contract relies on the security of the Stacks blockchain
- Signature verification is simplified for testing purposes
- Emergency withdrawal has no time lock

### Security Best Practices for Users

1. **Channel Management**

   - Regularly monitor channel status
   - Keep private keys secure
   - Maintain updated channel state

2. **Dispute Handling**

   - Monitor dispute periods
   - Keep signed state updates
   - Act promptly during disputes

3. **General Security**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Keep software updated
   - Follow security guidelines

## Updates and Patches

Security updates will be released as new versions of the contract. Users should:

1. Monitor for new releases
2. Review change logs
3. Update promptly when security patches are released
