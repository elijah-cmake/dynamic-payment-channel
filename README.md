# Dynamic Payment Channel Network

A robust smart contract implementation for managing dynamic payment channels on the Stacks blockchain, enabling secure, efficient, and trustless off-chain transactions between participants.

## Overview

This smart contract provides a complete solution for creating and managing payment channels on the Stacks blockchain. It enables participants to conduct multiple transactions off-chain while maintaining the security guarantees of the blockchain.

### Key Features

- Secure channel creation and management
- Dynamic funding capabilities
- Off-chain transaction support
- Cooperative channel closure
- Dispute resolution mechanism
- Built-in security measures

## Technical Architecture

The contract implements several key components:

1. **Channel Management**

   - Creation of unique payment channels
   - Dynamic channel funding
   - Balance tracking
   - State management

2. **Security Features**

   - Signature verification
   - Nonce tracking
   - Dispute resolution periods
   - Emergency withdrawal mechanisms

3. **Storage**
   - Efficient data structures
   - State persistence
   - Balance management

## Contract Functions

### Core Functions

```clarity
create-channel (channel-id, participant-b, initial-deposit)
fund-channel (channel-id, participant-b, additional-funds)
close-channel-cooperative (channel-id, participant-b, balance-a, balance-b, signature-a, signature-b)
initiate-unilateral-close (channel-id, participant-b, proposed-balance-a, proposed-balance-b, signature)
resolve-unilateral-close (channel-id, participant-b)
```

### Read-Only Functions

```clarity
get-channel-info (channel-id, participant-a, participant-b)
```

### Administrative Functions

```clarity
emergency-withdraw ()
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Stacks blockchain environment
- Clarity smart contract development tools
- STX tokens for testing and deployment

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up your Stacks development environment
3. Deploy the contract using Clarinet or your preferred deployment tool

### Usage Example

```clarity
;; Create a new payment channel
(contract-call? .payment-channel create-channel
    0x1234... ;; channel-id
    'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM ;; participant-b
    u1000000) ;; initial deposit in microSTX

;; Fund an existing channel
(contract-call? .payment-channel fund-channel
    0x1234...
    'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM
    u500000)
```

## Security Considerations

- All functions implement proper access controls
- Signature verification for state updates
- Dispute resolution mechanism with time locks
- Emergency withdrawal capabilities for contract owner

## Testing

Comprehensive tests are available in the test suite. Run them using Clarinet:

```bash
clarinet test
```
